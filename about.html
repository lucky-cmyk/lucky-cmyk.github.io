                    Rummy has been declared as a game of skill under Indian laws and is exempted from the applicability
                    of laws prohibiting betting and gambling. Though the element of chance cannot be entirely neglected
                    but the element of skill must be a predominant factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A certain amount of skill is required to play rummy as the fall of the cards need to be memorized
                    and it requires your real-time skills to build the correct rummy sequences by holding, drawing,
                    arranging and discarding the cards. Rummy unveils that Skill is a predominant factor over chance and
                    thus playing rummy online is absolutely legal in India.
