						<p class="text"><span class="strong">Rummy</span> is a card game that is played with two decks of cards with total of two Jokers. To win the rummy game a player must make a valid declaration by picking and discarding cards from the two piles given. One pile is a closed deck, where a player is unable to see the card that he is picking, while the other is an open deck that is formed by the cards discarded by the players. To win at rummy card game, the players have to group cards in valid sequences and sets.</p>
					</div>
					<p class="color">The Objective Of Rummy</p>
					<p class="text">The objective of rummy card game is to arrange the 13 cards in valid sets and sequences. To win the game you need to make minimum 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence and rest can be any valid sequence or sets. Without a pure sequence you cannot make a valid rummy declaration. This is one of the most important rummy rules.</p>
					<p class="ad"><img src="img/poker3.jpg" alt=""></p>
					<p class="colorB">How to Form Sequences?</p>
					<p class="text">In rummy, a sequence is a group of three or more consecutive cards of the same suit. There are two types of sequences that are formed; a pure sequence and an impure sequence. To win the game of rummy you need at least one pure sequence in your rummy hand.</p>
					<p class="colorB">Pure Sequence</p>
					<p class="text">A pure sequence is a group of three or more cards of the same suit, placed in consecutive order. To form a pure 
sequence in rummy card game, a player cannot use any Joker or wild card.
</p>
<p class="text">Here are a few examples of pure sequence.</p>

				 <div class="listStyle num">
				 	<div class="right">
				 		<p class="text"></p>
				 		<ul>
				 			<li>Rummy card game is played between 2 to 6 players with 2 decks of cards. Each player is dealt with 13 cards and a 
       random card is selected as wild joker or joker card of the game.</li> 
	   <li>The player has to draw and discard cards to form valid sets and sequences of the 13 cards in hand where player 
       can also use wild joker or printed joker of the deck to make impure sequence and sets.</li>
	   <li>As per indian rummy rules, once a player arranged 13 cards in valid 2 sequences including 1 pure sequence and 
       more groups (sequences or sets),one can make a declaration and win the game.</li>

				 <p class="color">Quick Tips To Win The Rummy Card Game</p>
				 <p class="text">Just as it's important to know the rummy rules, it is also necessary to play carefully and with focus. Here are quick tips to win the rummy game and stay a step ahead of your competitors.</p>
				 <div class="listStyle disc">
				 	<div class="right">
				 		<p class="text"></p>
				 		<ul>
				 			<li>Form the pure sequence at the very beginning of the game. Without a pure sequence, a player cannot make a 
    declaration.</li> 
	<li>Discard cards with high points like Ace, Jack, Queen and King. Replace these cards with Joker or Wild Cards. It 
    reduces the point load, in case you lose the game.</li>
	<li>As much as possible, avoid picking from the discard pile. It gives away what hand you are trying to form.</li>
	<li>Look out for smart cards. For example, a 7 of any suit can work with 5 and 6 of the same suit and also 8 and 9 of the
    same suit.</li>
	<li>Jokers play an important role in rummy. Try using them to replace high value cards. Remember, Joker and wild cards
    cannot be used to form pure sequence.</li>
	<li> When you are ready to make a declaration, check and recheck your cards and then press the button. An invalid 
    declaration can turn even a winning game into a complete loss.</li>

                <p class="color">Common Terms Used In Rummy Rules</p> 
                <p class="text">Here are some common terms of <span class="blue">Rummy handle</span> that every player needs to know before he starts playing.</p>
				<p class="colorB">What is a Rummy Table?</p>
				<p class="text">It is the table where the game of rummy is played. Every rummy table can sit two to six players for each game.</p>
				<p class="colorB">What is Joker and Wild Cards?</p>  
				<p class="text">In each rummy deck there is a Printed Joker and there is a Wild Card that is selected at random at the beginning of the game. The role of both these types of card is the same. Jokers are used to form sets and impure sequences. A Joker card can replace the desired number when forming the groups. This is a valid formation in a rummy game.</p> 
				<p class="colorB">What is Draw and Discard?</p> 
				<p class="text">In all Rummy games, each player is dealt 13 cards. Additionally, there are 2 stacks from which each player can select cards, thereby drawing a card. Once a player draws a card, he has to get rid of one card - this is called discarding.</p>  
				<p class="colorB">
What is Sorting of Cards?</p>  
				 <p class="text">Sorting of cards are done at the beginning of the game. This is done to arrange your cards to help you form your sets and sequences reducing the probability of mixing the cards. Once, the cards are displayed, you can hit the Sort button and start playing.</p> 
				<p class="colorB">What is a Drop?</p>
				<p class="text">When a player decides to leave the game table at the start or middle of the rummy game, it is a drop. The act is withdrawing from the game as a personal decision. The first drop=20 points; middle drop= 40 points and last drop and maximum point loss is 80 points.</p>  
				 <p class="text">In case of Pool rummy, if a player drops in 101 pool, the score is 20. In case, it is 201 pool rummy, the drop score is 25. In a game, where it is best of 2 and best of 3 is played, then a drop is not allowed.</p> 
				<p class="colorB">What is an Invalid Declaration?</p>  
				<p class="text">An invalid declaration happens in rummy card game when the player presses the Declaration button, but the cards are not in valid sequences and sets. Therefore, the player will lose the game and the competitor will automatically be declared as the winner.</p>  
				<p class="text">Here are few examples of common invalid declarations players make while playing rummy:</p>
				<div class="invalidBoxs">
					<div class="listStyle num">
						<div class="right">
							<p class="text"></p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p class="colorB">Wrong Declaration with Invalid Sets</p>
								<p class="text">Example 1: 10<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 10<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 10<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> 10<span class="club">&clubs;</span> Q<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span></p>	
								 <p class="text">A set can have 3 cards or more, however a set needs to be formed with cards of the same value and different suits. In this situation, the Wild Joker (Queen of Hearts) card was added and that became the fifth card, which is valid as per rules, however the group consist of 2 cards of the same suit making it a wrong declaration.</p>
								<p class="text">Example 2: K<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> K<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> K<span class="diamond">&diams;</span></p>
								 <p class="text">In this set, there are 3 cards which is well within the minimum limit. Also, a set consists of cards of the same face value but has to be of different suits. The set cannot have more than one card of the same suit. In this example, the set consists of two cards of the same suit and that makes it a wrong declaration.</p>
								</li> 
								<li>
									<p class="colorB">Wrong Declaration with Invalid Sequences</p>
									<p class="text">Example 1: 10<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 10<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 10<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> 10<span class="club">&clubs;</span> | 5<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 5<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 5<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> | 6<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 6<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 6<span class="club">&clubs;</span> | 9<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 9<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> Joker</p>
									<p class="text">A valid declaration requires 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence i.e. sequence without joker and the other can be pure or impure sequence i.e. sequence with or without joker. However, in the given example there is neither sequence made making it an invalid declaration.</p>
									<p class="text">Example 2: K<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> K<span class="spade">&spades;</span> K<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> | 6<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 7<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> Joker | 9<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 10<span class="spade">&spades;</span> J<span class="spade">&spades;</span> Joker | 5<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 5<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 5<span class="diamond">&diams;</span></p>
									<p class="text">A valid declaration must have 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence i.e. sequence without joker and the other can be pure or impure sequence i.e. sequence with or without joker. This example shows that there are 2 sequences, but both are impure sequence i.e. sequence with joker and the pure sequence is not there. It is compulsory to have a pure sequence before you make a declaration.</p>
									<p class="text">Example 3: Q<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> Q<span class="spade">&spades;</span> Q<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> | 6<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 7<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 8<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 9<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> | 5<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 5<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 5<span class="diamond">&diams;</span> | 10<span class="spade">&spades;</span> 10<span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> 10<span class="diamond">&diams;</span></p>
									<p class="text">Sequences are very important for a rummy card game and you need minimum 2 sequences, out of which one needs to be pure sequence and the other can be pure or impure sequence to win the game. In this example, there is a pure sequence, however the 2nd sequence is missing and hence it is an invalid declaration.</p>
